# Hi, I'm Andrew :>

---

I am an **18-year-old student from Scotland**, currently studying **first-year computer science**. I am passionate about programming, music, and anything that overlaps the two. In my spare time you'll find me performing piano or percussion, hacking away at hobby projects, dabbling in parkour and other acrobatic sports, or (usually accidentally) breaking computer systems.

Feel free to have a browse around here - it's a humble profile but you may find something that piques your interest :>
